# Homework 2 - eCommerce analytics
In this homework our task is to comprehend the behaviour of the eCommerce in October and November through a series of questions.
## Data
The data we are going to work with are from the website Kaggle, in particular we download the dataset of October and November.
Each dataset contains nine columns:
* event_time (time when event happened at (in UTC))
* event_type
   * view ( a user viewed a product)
   * cart (a user added a product to shopping cart) 
   * purchase (a user purchased a product)
* product_id (ID of a product)
* category_id (product's category ID)
* category_code (product's category taxonomy)
* brand (downcased string of brand name)
* price (float price of a product)
* user_id (user ID)
* user_session (temporary user's session ID)

Our records could miss the values of brand and category_code.

## Dataset
According to the questions we use October dataset, November dataset or the combination of these two obtaines as their concatenation.
